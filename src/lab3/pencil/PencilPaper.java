package lab3.pencil;

public class PencilPaper {

	public static void main(String[] args) {


		/*
		
		1. 
		
		class Account {
			double balance;
			Employee emp;
		
			public void getBalance() {
				return balance;
			}
		}
		
		
		In this class problem is with the indentation of the code and getBalance() has returned balance but it's declared 
		as void. it should be double like 
		
		public double getBalance() {
			return balance;
		}
		
		
		2. 
		
		Text size are different and those need to be in same size. 
		Code will be more readable if we do so. 
		
		
		3. 
		
		class Company{
			Employee[] employee;
			public Employee[] getAllEmployees(){
				return employee;
			}
		}
		
		
		I did not find any problem with the code. but instance name can be changed according to the convention
		
		
		4. 
		class Department{
		
			public double ComputeSalary(Employee emp){
			
				String status = emp.getStatus();
				double BaseSalary = lookupBaseSalary(status);
				double Bonus = lookupBonus(emp);
				return BaseSalary+Bonus;
			}
		
		}
		
		Variable name should maintain the coding convention.
		
		
		
		5. 	Four (names of) classes belonging to a Java application are given below. 
			Your task is to organize these classes into two packages, each containing
		 	two of the classes. Think of good names for the two packages, state which 
		 	of the packages each of the classes belongs to, and give a short
		  	explanation of your choice of package names.
		
		     Employee
		     Customer
		     CustomerAccount
		     Manager
		     
		     Packages name should be employees and customers
		     
		     in "customers" package following classes 
		     Customer
		     CustomerAccount
		     
		     in "employees" package following classes
		     Employee
		     Manager
